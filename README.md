## Config vars 📖
- `APP_ID` - Your APP ID. Get it from [my.telegram.org](my.telegram.org)
- `API_HASH` - Your API_HASH. Get it from [my.telegram.org](my.telegram.org)
- `BOT_OWNER` - Your Telegram Account ID. Get it from [@MissRose_bot](https://t.me/MissRose_bot) (Start the bot and send <samp>/info</samp> command).
- `BOT_TOKEN` - Bot Token of Your Telegram Bot. Get it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

```
clean - Remove your archives from my servers 🚮♻️
